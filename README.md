# RNRxBluetooth

React Native Reactive Bluetooth Library which let you interact with Bluetooth devices [reactively](http://reactivex.io/) from your [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native) application.

This is a simple wrapper around underlying Android and iOS libraries. Current support is:
+ Android, using [RxBluetooth](https://github.com/IvBaranov/RxBluetooth): :white_check_mark:
+ iOS, using [RxBluetoothKit](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit): :x:  *(any help appreciated)*

# Run the example

Go to the `./RNRxBluetoothExample` and run the following commands:

```
npm install
react-native run-android # or react-native run-ios when supported
```

# Thanks!

Thanks a lot to [RxBluetooth](https://github.com/IvBaranov/RxBluetooth) and [RxBluetoothKit](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit) maintainers and contributors!
